// The neural-runtime seam.  One interface, two backends behind it.
//
// `ffpipe.cpp` is the geometry and the swap chain; it should not know whether a graph runs
// on the Hexagon NPU through QNN or on the CPU/GPU through ncnn.  Until this header existed
// it called `ffqnn::` directly in 24 places and resolved context filenames itself, which
// meant every non-Qualcomm ambition had to start by rewriting the pipeline.
//
// EIGHT functions, and the shape of `open` is the important one.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why open() takes a LOGICAL NAME
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The two backends do not name files alike, and not merely cosmetically:
//
//     QNN    yoloface_v79.bin              one file, arch tier in the name
//     ncnn   yoloface_8n_b1.ncnn.param     TWO files, no tier, and the graph's own name
//            yoloface_8n_b1.ncnn.bin
//
// A caller that builds paths cannot be backend-neutral, so it does not build them: it asks
// for "yoloface" and the backend resolves its own. That also moves the arch-tier logic out
// of ffpipe entirely -- tiers are a QNN concept and mean nothing to ncnn.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why PLACEMENT is per model
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Measured 2026-08-30, and this is not a preference:
//
//   * The CONTENT GATE must not run on the GPU. ncnn's Vulkan moves its decision statistic
//     by -0.106 mean / -0.175 max, AWAY from flagging, against a 0.25 threshold -- it errs
//     toward allowing, which is the one direction a gate must not err. On MNN's GPU paths it
//     is also the slowest model measured. It runs ~11 times per video, so CPU costs nothing.
//   * The ENHANCER cannot run on the GPU at all. gpen fails on ncnn Vulkan (10.86 dB, wrong
//     even with every fp16 path disabled), MNN OpenCL (segfault) and MNN Vulkan (segfault).
//     Three independent implementations, one StyleGAN generator.
//
// So a single global "use the GPU" switch would be wrong for two of six graphs. Placement
// belongs to the model, not to the session.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// And whether the GPU is RIGHT is a per-DEVICE question, not a per-model one
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Everything above was measured on one Adreno. ncnn's Vulkan is a different implementation
// on every GPU vendor, and a graph that is correct on an Adreno can be silently wrong on
// another part -- reported from the field as "it detects a lot and none of them is a face",
// which is exactly what yoloface's head looks like when its output is noise. The swap then
// runs on those boxes and produces a video of nothing.
//
// So `Default` no longer means "the GPU" unconditionally. It means "the GPU if this GPU
// agrees with this device's own CPU", checked once, on the first open that asks for it --
// see `verifyGpu` in ffnn_ncnn.cpp. `Placement::Cpu` is untouched by any of this: the gate
// and the enhancer are correctness pins and nothing may move them.
