        //
        //   getFrameAtTime(OPTION_CLOSEST) is a REQUEST. On a 12.5 s clip with a ~5 s
        //   keyframe interval it returned TWO distinct images for the whole timeline --
        //   every seek from 1.1 s to 4.5 s gave byte-identical pixels in a fresh Bitmap.
        //   On the other clip the same call was exact.
        //
        //   getFrameAtIndex IS exact, and unusable on precisely the files that need it: it
        //   reads METADATA_KEY_VIDEO_FRAME_COUNT itself and throws NumberFormatException:
        //   s == null when the container has none. Computing the count in Kotlin does not
        //   help, because the platform never sees our number. The failing clip has no
        //   count; the working one does.
        //
        // So FrameSeeker decodes: seek to the sync frame at or before the target, decode
        // forward, keep the first frame that reaches it. That is what VideoSwapper already
        // does for a real run, which is the other reason to prefer it -- a preview that
        // disagrees with the output is not a preview. Bounded by a deadline so a
        // pathological file costs one slow seek rather than a pane that never fills.
        //
        // 21 = 0.4.13 (2026-08-31): loading a second target previews it.
        //
        // ⚠ `targetFile` CANNOT be a state key. Every target is copied to the same path,
        // File(cacheDir, "target.mp4"), and File.equals compares path strings -- so the
        // File for a new video is EQUAL to the File for the old one, the LaunchedEffect
        // keyed on it never re-fires, and the auto-warm that draws the swapped pane never
        // runs for any target after the first. The bench log shows it plainly: loading a
        // second clip produced no `autowarm fired` line at all.
        //
        // Long-standing, and invisible until 0.4.5 because the pane fell back to the
        // PREVIOUS target's swapped frame. Clearing that stale frame turned a wrong preview
        // into an empty one, and an empty one is what finally got reported -- as "preview
        // not loaded on first load", which is really every load after the first.
        //
        // A monotonic counter replaces it: bumped on load and on clear, and it cannot be
        // equal to its predecessor by construction.
        //
        // Also: the frame count falls back to duration x fps when the container does not
        // publish METADATA_KEY_VIDEO_FRAME_COUNT, since without a count getFrameAtIndex has
        // no index to ask for and the keyframe snapping of 0.4.12 stands.
        //
        // 20 = 0.4.12 (2026-08-31): the preview follows the trim handle.
        //
        // MEASURED, after two builds of guessing: seeks to 1646 ms and 3616 ms returned
        // BYTE-IDENTICAL frames in freshly allocated Bitmaps, while 8838 ms -- in the next
        // GOP -- differed. The retriever was snapping to sync frames, so most of a drag
        // previewed the same picture. Nothing upstream was at fault: every seek fired,
        // every refresh started warm, the swap ran and found its 5 faces each time. The
        // frame handed to it was simply the wrong one.
        //
        // getFrameAtTime's OPTION_CLOSEST is a REQUEST, not a contract -- a hardware-backed
        // retriever may ignore it, and this one does. getFrameAtIndex is exact, so the time
        // becomes an index through the file's own frame count, with OPTION_CLOSEST kept as
        // the fallback for containers that do not publish one.
        //
        // ⚠ The two fixes in 0.4.9 were aimed at this and MISSED: the log shows not one
        // dropped refresh and not one late seek. They stay because both describe real
        // hazards -- a dropped redraw and a MediaMetadataRetriever entered from three
        // coroutines while close() can release it -- but neither was this bug, and neither
        // should be cited as having fixed it.
        //
        // 19 = 0.4.11 (2026-08-31): what each seek PRODUCED, not just that it ran.
        //
        // 0.4.10's log settled the scheduling question and killed both of 0.4.9's theories:
        // every seek fires, every refresh starts, the pipeline is warm throughout. So the
        // pane not changing is downstream of all of it. This logs the frame each seek
        // returned -- identity and three sampled pixels -- and what the swap made of it,
        // because a retriever that snaps to the same keyframe hands back a FRESH Bitmap
        // holding IDENTICAL pixels, which is indistinguishable from a pane that will not
        // repaint until you look at the content.
        //
        // 18 = 0.4.10 (2026-08-31): the preview path says why it did nothing.
        //
        // 0.4.9 guessed at two mechanisms for "the frame does not update on seek" and fixed
        // neither -- it also left the pane stuck on "Preparing preview" on first load. The
        // logcat from that build shows one getFrameAtTime and then silence: no ffqnn init,
        // no second seek. So refreshSwapped is returning early, and NOTHING RECORDS WHICH
        // of its five silent `return`s took it.
        //
        // That is the same defect as the QNN error string this session opened with: a
        // decision made and not written down, and two builds spent guessing because of it.
        // One debug line per refusal, plus the auto-warm effect and the seek job, on a tag
        // nothing else uses: `adb logcat -s ffpreview`.
        //
        // 17 = 0.4.9 (2026-08-31): seeking updates the panes every time.
        //
        // Two independent ways a scrub was lost, both older than this session.
        //
        // refreshSwapped `return`ed when previewBusy and nothing ever asked again, so a
        // redraw requested while a preview swap was in flight was DROPPED -- which is
        // precisely what dragging produces, and the swapped pane then kept the previous
        // position until something else happened to trigger it. It coalesces now.
        //
        // And MediaMetadataRetriever is NOT thread safe. Scrubbing cancels the previous
        // seek and starts another, but cancellation is cooperative and getFrameAtTime is a
        // blocking native call that does not observe it, so the old seek is still inside
        // the retriever when the new one enters. Two concurrent reads return null or the
        // wrong frame; closeTarget could release it under a read outright. One monitor now
        // covers open, close and every read.
        //
        // 16 = 0.4.8 (2026-08-31): the pipeline stops reloading for values it reads per
        // frame, and the frame-rate labels sit on the stops they name.
        //
        // The last of the reload bugs, and the root of all of them. `PreviewEngine` keyed
        // the LOADED pipeline on the whole `SwapOptions`, so every field forced a teardown.
        // But ffpipe reads every Config field once per FRAME -- weight, mask blur, padding,
        // detector and landmarker scores, pixel boost, largest-only, the enhancer's on/off
        // and its blend -- and consumes none of them at init. `gpen` in particular is opened
        // whether or not faceEnhance is set, because the flag decides whether the STAGE
        // RUNS. Turning the enhancer off reloaded ~300 MB of contexts to flip a bool.
        //
        // outputFps was the clearest case: it never reaches the native pipeline at all,
        // VideoSwapper takes it directly, and changing it still reloaded every model.
        //
        // So `Pipeline::updateConfig` + a `setOptions` JNI push the tunables to a loaded
        // pipeline, and the load is keyed on the SWAPPER alone -- the one option that
        // really does select a different model file. The clamping is now one shared helper,
        // because a second copy is how the live path ends up trusting Kotlin.
        //
        // The debounce in previewOptionsChanged stops being load-bearing: its own comment
        // said "a drag would otherwise ask for a full model reload dozens of times a
        // second", and now there is no reload to ask for.
        //
        // 15 = 0.4.7 (2026-08-31): three things asked for while testing 0.4.6.
        //
        // SAVE FRAME on the swapped PREVIEW. The output pane has had one since the video
        // path existed, but it reads frames back out of a FINISHED video -- so pulling one
        // still out of a clip meant swapping the whole clip first, which on the CPU backend
        // is minutes for a picture already on screen.
        //
        // FRAME RATE reaches 5/10/15 now, and is a slider. 24/30/60 could only take a 30 fps
        // clip down to 24 -- a 20% saving against a backend an order of magnitude slower
        // than the NPU -- and on a 24 fps clip nothing qualified, so the control hid itself
        // and offered no reduction at all. VideoSwapper already decimated BEFORE the swap,
        // so the saving was always real; the stops were the part that was not useful.
        //
        // PANE HEADERS are inside the pane. The caption and its buttons sat flush against
        // the pane's outer edge while the image below was clipped to a rounded box, so the
        // text read as belonging to the page rather than to the pane under it.
        //
        // 14 = 0.4.6 (2026-08-31): changing the SOURCE stopped reloading the models too,
        // and the empty target pane says TARGET.
        //
        // 13 fixed the target paths and left the source one, which has the same shape: the
        // warm key was `WarmKey(opts, sourceTag)`, so a new source tore down every context
        // and rebuilt it. No model depends on the source -- only `setSource` does, which
        // analyses one image and keeps a 512-float embedding. The key is now two fields:
        // options decide whether to RELOAD, the source decides whether to RE-APPLY.
        //
        // A failed `setSource` still releases. ffpipe::setSource leaves the previous
        // embedding in place when it finds no face, so a pipeline that survived a failed
        // source change is one that would swap the PREVIOUS person's face.
        //
        // ⚠ The code goes up even though 0.4.5 was never released: it went to the phone's
        // Downloads, which is where builds leave this machine, and two different binaries
        // calling themselves 0.4.5 is the 0.2.0 ambiguity again.
        //
        // 13 = 0.4.5 (2026-08-31): picking a new target stopped reloading the models.
        //
        // The photo path called invalidatePreview(), which tears the native pipeline down.
        // Nothing about a target is loaded -- the warm key is the options and the SOURCE,
        // and frames go to processFrame one at a time -- so every context was reloaded to
        // show a frame the loaded models could already swap. Invisible on the NPU; seconds
        // of "Loading models" on the CPU backend, which is where it was reported.
        //
        // The video path had the mirror image of the same confusion: it cleared
        // `swappedFrame` but not `preview`, and the pane resolves `swappedFrame ?: preview`,
        // so a new video could show the PREVIOUS target's swapped face. One helper that
        // clears the frames without touching the pipeline fixes both.
        //
        // ⚠ The auto-warm effect also required `!previewWarm`, which made a warm pipeline
        // the one case it would not redraw for. Both bugs above were hiding that: each path
        // went cold by accident, so the guard was never the thing standing in the way.
        //

        // not a linker hint -- so 0.4.0 shipped a non-Qualcomm backend to an audience the

        // comment on GitHub and worked out why before anyone here did. That is also the
        // whole reason "no non-Qualcomm phone has ever run the ncnn path": none could.
        //
        // And `ffnn_qnn.cpp`'s error string was sticky AND shadowed the runner's own, so

        // and the API's LAN switch that was inert whenever the server was off.
        //
        // 9 = 0.4.1 (2026-08-30): ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡ and ç¹é«”ä¸­æ–‡, and the bug report button reaching
        // the place four releases of documentation said it already was. `Settings > Share
        // bug report` did not exist; the only control was on the Swap screen, and only when
        // the status began with "Failed" -- so a swap that finished and looked wrong, which
        // is the report this project most needs from hardware it does not own, had no
        // button at all.
        //
        // ⚠ The CODE goes up even though 0.4.0 was published hours ago. The published
        // 0.4.0 and this build are different binaries, and this repo has already paid once
        // for two APKs calling themselves the same version (0.2.0, versionCodes 3 and 4).
        //
        // 8 = 0.4.0 (2026-08-30): the NON-QUALCOMM path, linked and shipped. FF_NCNN is on
        // whenever work/android/ncnn/ is staged, the ncnn model set is selectable from the
        // downloader, and Settings can pin the runtime so the path is testable on a phone
        // that has a Hexagon -- which is the only kind of phone this project owns, and
        // therefore the difference between "written" and "verified".
        //
        // ⚠ The APK grows from 48.0 MB to 65.7 MB (+17.7). The static libraries are ~168 MB
        // and libffnative.so is 78.3 MB unpacked, so the INSTALLED footprint grows far more
        // than the download does -- jniLibs are stored compressed and extracted at install.
        // Measured, not estimated; the ~98 MB the handoff feared was the archive, not the
        // cost.
        //
        // 7 = 0.3.0 (2026-08-30): the tier FALLBACK -- a tier that loads but will not run
        // now falls back instead of leaving the app unusable -- the gate's failure reason
        // surfaced instead of discarded, and the v81 tier restored, which the fallback is
        // what makes safe. The ffnn runtime seam and the ncnn backend were in the tree but
        // NOT linked (FF_NCNN=OFF): unexercised through the APK, so not in that release.
        //
        // 6 = 0.2.2 (2026-08-30): the CONTENT GATE input range. facefusion feeds nsfw_2
        // [-1,1] and this port fed it [0,1] from the gate's first release, which moves the
        // decision statistic 4.6x its own threshold. The quantised gate is renamed
        // `nsfwq2_` so an app on the new range cannot silently load encodings calibrated
        // for the old one -- it reports the gate missing and offers the download instead.
        //
        // 5 = 0.2.1 (2026-08-30): the v81 tier, the 9.5x face enhancer, the output-file
        // leak, and "update available" in the model inventory.
        //
        // ⚠ The NAME moves this time, unlike the hotfix. Reusing "0.2.0" was right for 4:
        // it was the same release, refetched at the same link, by the same users. This is
        // not that -- it publishes a new model tier and replaces a hosted model in every
        // existing one. A third binary called 0.2.0 would have made the download link
        // ambiguous for the 47 people who already took the second one, so v0.2.1 is a NEW
        // tag and a NEW asset name, and v0.2.0 keeps pointing at what it always did.
        // archivesBaseName follows versionName, so the filename moves with it.
        // 58 = the 0.7.0 optional-model regression: the enhancer and the lip syncer
        // had a Download button that started the BULK fetch, which excludes them by
        // name -- so it fetched nothing and reported "Models ready".  Same 0.7.0
        // name, fifth asset; the code is the only thing that tells them apart.
        // 59 = the chip that triggered the download now comes ON when it lands. The
        // tap was an enable; 58 made the model arrive and left the stage off, so the
        // user had to ask twice and the first ask looked like it had failed.
        // 60 = 0.8.0 opens. 0.7.0 is published and its asset is versionCode 59, so
        // the moment a feature lands locally the build stops being that release and
        // must stop calling itself one -- a bug report naming "0.7.0" has to mean the
        // thing on GitHub. Features from here (roadmap 13a, 2b, 12b, 14, 13b) bump
        // the CODE only; the name moves again when 0.8.0 is actually released.
        // ⚠ THE NAME MOVES WITH EVERY BUILD THAT LEAVES THIS MACHINE, not just with
        // every release. Asked for 2026-09-06: quoting a versionCode to say which
        // build someone is holding is precise and useless to them. 0.7.0 had four
        // APKs and 0.8.0 had ten, and in both cases the NAME could not tell them
        // apart -- which is the whole ambiguity the version rule exists to stop.
        // 85 = PR #3 lands (squash d041ed4): the swap screen rebuild, the 72dp face tiles,
        // the monochrome theme with a pinned light/dark choice, and the @Immutable +
        // 10 Hz recomposition fix.  v0.9.12 is published and is versionCode 84, so this
        // build has stopped being that release and must stop answering to its name.
        // 86 = #3's layout reverted on the bench's own judgement, the theme, the perf fix
        // and the translations kept.  A separate CODE because 85 left this machine and is
        // installed on the test phone: reusing it would leave two different layouts
        // answering to one version, which is the ambiguity the rule exists to stop.
        // 87 = the band's missing gap under its own divider, and the run preview at the
        // rate the NPU can actually feed it.
        // 88 = an optional model that is absent by design stopped logging at ERROR.
        // 97 = the non-Qualcomm GPU path checks its own Vulkan against its own CPU before
        // placing anything on it, and the per-frame encoder feed stopped trusting one
        // encoder's buffer arithmetic. v0.9.24 is published and is versionCode 96, so this
        // build has stopped being that release and must stop answering to its name.
        // 98 = `--es unit auto|gpu|cpu`, so the ncnn unit pin can be driven from a script.
        // 97 is installed on the bench and sitting in its Downloads: reusing the name would
        // leave two builds answering to it, which is the ambiguity the rule exists to stop.
        // 99 = PR #6 merged: the frozen pre-swap photo row for Assign per person on
        // both screens, assign-per-person on stills, the Live swapper picker, and
        // hyperswap 1b/1c selectable when their binary is present. The correction on
        // top dropped the Import button -- a hand-picked file of the right NAME is not
        // the model, and the download path SHA256s every byte against the manifest.
        // v0.9.26 is published and is versionCode 98, so this build has stopped being
        // that release and must stop answering to its name.
        // 100 = the API server stopped coming back by itself. START_STICKY had
        // Android re-create the service after a memory kill, with a null intent that
        // fell through every guard -- reported from the bench as "the api notif starts
        // running on its own".
        // 102 = Live controls ordered by what a person touches mid-session, the swapper
        // picker off that screen entirely, a fullscreen feed, source faces that survive a
        // restart, and the version on the About tab.
        // 103 = the fullscreen exit button cleared the gesture bar (it was UNREACHABLE),
        // theme moved to the Device tab, the swapper dialog says what is actually known
        // about 1a/1b/1c, and saved faces became a bookmark plus a library popup.
        // 104 = the keep button toggles and shows which state it is in, the library's
        // delete stopped leaving it stuck, every face action confirms, and four icons in
        // one slot stopped touching.
        // 105 = the fullscreen exit stopped hiding under the navigation bar (the dialog
        // window was never set up edge-to-edge, so its insets read as nothing), Use lost
        // its confirmation, and the primary action on both screens follows the scroll.
